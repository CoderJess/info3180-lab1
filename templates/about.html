            Hello, I'm Shaquille. I am a Computer Science student, studying at
            the University of the West Indies. As a coding enthusiast, I enjoy
            software/web development, with experiences in languages such as python, 
            java, javascript, c, php and frameworks such as reactjs, nodejs and django.
            I also often like to engage in learning new technologies in order to widen my 
            spectrum. I hope to work as a Software Developer in the near future, in aims 
            of helping to create new technologies.
