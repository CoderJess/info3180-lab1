    <p>
        Hello, I'm Shaquille. I am a Computer Science student, studying at
        the University of the West Indies. As a coding enthusiast, I enjoy
        software/web development, with experiences in languages such as python, 
        java, javascript, c, php and frameworks such as reactjs, nodejs and django.
        I also often like to engage in learning new technologies in order to widen my 
        spectrum. I hope to work as a Software Developer in the near future, in aims 
        of helping to create new technologies.
